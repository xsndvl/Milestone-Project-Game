# Milestone-Project-Game
This is a simple game that consists of the user clicking on blocks to earn points!
If the amount of squares on the screen at one time rises to 20, the game is lost.
Making this game was great because it was frustrating at so many times when things would just not work, yet it felt amazing when things did work. 
This game is not perfect but it challenged me in such a way that made me look forward to working on it and it is the first real feeling I have of accomplishment in coding.
I hope once I learn more, I can do better in the amount of time it takes me to figure things out or to be able to recognize patterns and turn them to functions more often.
